# SimpleNfa

A simple implementation of the DFA described in chapter one of Michael
Siper's *Introduction to the Theory of Computation*.  This is a somewhat
naive implementation, but it's straight out of the book, if not entirely
straight out of the mathematics.  See the comments in src/SimpleNfa.hs
for the details on how engineering expedience overrode mathematical 
meticulousness.
